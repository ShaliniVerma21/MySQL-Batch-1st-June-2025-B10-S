-- Foriegn Keys
-- Delete and Update Cascade

/*What are Foreign Keys?
 A foreign key is a field in one table that links to the primary key of another table.
 It creates a relationship between the two tables.*/

/*Delete Cascade
A delete cascade means that when a record in the parent table
(the table with the primary key) is deleted, all corresponding records
in the child table (the table with the foreign key) will also be deleted
automatically.*/

/*Update Cascade
An update cascade means that when the primary key of a record in the
parent table is updated, all corresponding foreign keys in the child
table will also be updated automatically.*/
