GROUP BY column1;

It works similarly to the WHERE clause but is applied to aggregated results.

Syntax:

SELECT column1, aggregate_function(column2)  
FROM table_name  
GROUP BY column1  
HAVING condition;  
*/

-- Select arrival airports with an average flight duration greater than 100 minutes
SELECT Arrival_Airport, AVG(Flight_Duration) AS AverageDuration FROM Flights GROUP BY Arrival_Airport 
HAVING AVG(Flight_Duration) > 100;


-- 7. LIMIT (or FETCH or TOP) Clause

/*

In MySQL, the LIMIT clause is used to restrict the number of rows returned by a query. 
Unlike some other SQL databases (e.g., SQL Server or PostgreSQL) that use TOP or FETCH, 
MySQL exclusively supports LIMIT. 

Syntax for LIMIT

SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
LIMIT [offset,] row_count;

Key Components

1. row_count: Specifies the number of rows to return.
2. offset (optional): Specifies the starting point from which rows are returned. If omitted, 
the default is 0 (start from the first row).
3. LIMIT: Used to specify the maximum number of records to return.
4. Using LIMIT with a comma: An alternative way to specify both the offset and the limit in a single clause.
5. ROW_COUNT(): While not directly applicable, you can use SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS and FOUND_ROWS() to get the 
total count of rows.

-- Get the total number of flights and limit the results
SELECT SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS * FROM Flights LIMIT 5; 

SELECT FOUND_ROWS();  -- This will return the total number of rows without the LIMIT


-- 8. JOIN Clause

/*
The JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column.

Syntax:

SELECT columns  
FROM table1  
JOIN table2  
ON table1.common_column = table2.common_column;  

Note - to join 2 or more table their 1 attributes must be common.

INNER JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables.

LEFT JOIN: Returns all records from the left table (Flights) and the matched records from the right 
table (Bookings or Airlines). If there is no match, NULL values are returned for columns from the right table.

RIGHT JOIN: Returns all records from the right table (Bookings) and the matched records from the left table 
(Flights). If there is no match, NULL values are returned for columns from the left table.

-- Mysql Alias

/*

In MySQL, an alias is a temporary name assigned to a table or a column for the duration of a query
(within the scope of a query). Aliases are primarily used to enhance the readability and clarity of 
SQL statements, making it easier for users to understand the purpose of the data being retrieved or manipulated.

Key Points about MySQL Aliases:

1. Temporary Nature: 
Aliases exist only for the duration of the query. Once the query execution is complete, 
the alias ceases to exist.

2. Improved Readability: 
By using aliases, you can simplify complex column names or provide more meaningful names 
that better describe the data. This is particularly useful when dealing with long or complicated column names.

Syntax:

For column aliases, the syntax is:

SELECT column_name AS alias_name
FROM table_name;

For table aliases, the syntax is:

SELECT column_name
FROM table_name AS alias_name;

3. Usage in Queries: 
Aliases can be used in various SQL statements, including SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE. 
They can also be used in conjunction with aggregate functions, joins, and subqueries.

4. No Impact on Database Structure: 
Using an alias does not change the actual table or column names in the database; 
it only affects how they arek referenced in the query.

Naming Conventions:

If you are creating constraints, it's a good practice to use a consistent naming convention. 
This can help you easily identify constraints later. A common convention is to use the format:

For CHECK constraints: chk_<table>_<column>
For UNIQUE constraints: unique_<table>_<column>
For FOREIGN KEY constraints: fk_<table>_<referenced_table>

Example of Adding Constraints with Naming Conventions

ALTER TABLE Flights
